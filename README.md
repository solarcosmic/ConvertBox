# ConvertBox
Convert images and more without leaving your browser. Entirely client-sided.

## How does ConvertBox work?
ConvertBox uses a variety of tools and modules to convert what is needed client-sided without sending anything to a third party. Everything runs directly in your browser.

## Why would ConvertBox be needed?
Some of the time, you may stumble across an image you want to use in your project, for example, but the format is something like .avif. ConvertBox can fix that in only two clicks, while doing everything locally.

## Why was ConvertBox made?
ConvertBox was made for [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/projects/2390) by Hack Club. It has solved a problem I always had, saving time efficiently.

## What browsers is ConvertBox available on?
ConvertBox is available for both Chrome-based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge), but is also available for Firefox-based browsers (Firefox, Zen Browser, LibreWolf).
